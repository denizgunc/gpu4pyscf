GPU plugin for PySCF
====================
![nightly](https://github.com/pyscf/gpu4pyscf/actions/workflows/nightly_build.yml/badge.svg)
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/gpu4pyscf-cuda11x.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/gpu4pyscf-cuda11x)

Installation
--------

> [!NOTE]
> The compiled binary packages support compute capability 7.0 and later (Volta and later, such as Tesla V100, RTX 20 series and later).

To check your installed CUDA Toolkit version, run
```sh
nvcc --version
```
Then, install the appropriate package based on your CUDA version:

| Platform      | Command                               | cutensor (**highly recommended**)|
----------------| --------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **CUDA 11.x** |  ```pip3 install gpu4pyscf-cuda11x``` | ```pip3 install cutensor-cu11``` |
| **CUDA 12.x** |  ```pip3 install gpu4pyscf-cuda12x``` | ```pip3 install cutensor-cu12``` |
| **CUDA 13.x** |  ```pip3 install gpu4pyscf-cuda13x``` | ```pip3 install cutensor-cu13``` |

The versions of CuPy and cuTENSOR are strongly interdependent and should not be combined arbitrarily.
The recommended combinations include:
1. CuPy 13.3.0 + cuTENSOR 2.0.2
2. CuPy 13.4.1 + cuTENSOR 2.2.0

Using other versions or combinations may lead to failures in functionality. 
We **recommend** creating a dedicated environment using:
```sh
pip3 install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
```
This ensures compatibility and reproducibility, especially since this configuration is used in our nightly benchmarks.

Compilation
--------
To compile the package, run the following commands:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/pyscf/gpu4pyscf.git
cd gpu4pyscf
cmake -S gpu4pyscf/lib -B build/temp.gpu4pyscf
cmake --build build/temp.gpu4pyscf -j 4
CURRENT_PATH=`pwd`
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:${CURRENT_PATH}"
```
Then install cutensor and cupy for acceleration (please switch the versions according to your runtime CUDA environment!)
```sh
pip3 install cutensor-cu12 cupy-cuda12x
```
There shouldn't be cupy or cutensor compilation during pip install process. If you see the following warning at the beginning of a gpu4pyscf job, it implies problems with cupy and cutensor installation (likely a version mismatch, or multiple versions of same package installed).
```
<repo_path>/gpu4pyscf/lib/cutensor.py:<line_number>: UserWarning: using cupy as the tensor contraction engine.
```

Building for AMD GPUs (ROCm)
--------
gpu4pyscf also runs on AMD GPUs through ROCm/HIP. It is built from source with
the standard `pip`/`setup.py` path (`USE_HIP=1` selects the HIP backend). The HIP
kernels are compiled for each GPU's native wavefront automatically — 32-wide on
RDNA (Radeon) and 64-wide on CDNA (Instinct) — so the same source produces a
correct binary for one GPU, or a single "fat" binary for many.

Prerequisites: a working [ROCm](https://rocm.docs.amd.com) install (with
`hipconfig`/`amdclang++` on `PATH`, or `ROCM_PATH` set) and a ROCm build of
[CuPy](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/install.html#using-cupy-on-amd-gpu-experimental).

Build and install:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/pyscf/gpu4pyscf.git
cd gpu4pyscf
USE_HIP=1 pip install .        # autodetect this machine's GPU
# add -e for an editable/development install
```

Use `GPU_TARGET` to choose what hardware to build for (an explicit
`GPU_ARCHITECTURES="gfx...;..."` list overrides it):

| `GPU_TARGET`             | Builds for                                                    |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `native` (default)       | the GPU(s) installed in this machine (auto-detected)          |
| `gfx942`, `gfx1100;...`  | one specific GPU, or an explicit `;`-separated list           |
| `cdna`                   | AMD Instinct datacenter GPUs (MI100/MI200/MI300/MI350, wave64)|
| `rdna`                   | AMD Radeon RDNA2+ GPUs and APUs (RX 6000/7000/9000, wave32)   |
| `all`                    | all of the above, in a single binary (CDNA + RDNA)            |

```sh
USE_HIP=1 GPU_TARGET=all  pip install .          # one binary for all AMD GPUs
USE_HIP=1 GPU_TARGET=cdna pip wheel . -w dist/    # redistributable wheel
```

When working against an editable install, recompile the libraries in place with
`USE_HIP=1 python setup.py build_py` (it accepts the same `GPU_TARGET`).

> [!NOTE]
> AMD has no portable-IR fallback (unlike CUDA's PTX), so device code is emitted
> per architecture: each one adds ~40 MB. A single-GPU build is ~40 MB; an `all`
> binary is a few hundred MB. Build one family (`rdna`/`cdna`) or a specific
> `GPU_TARGET` to keep it small.

The [HIP build CI](.github/workflows/hip_build.yml) compiles and links the native
libraries on GitHub-hosted CPU runners using `USE_HIP=1 GPU_TARGET=all` in a
pinned ROCm development container. This compiles all supported CDNA and RDNA
targets in a single build and requires no AMD GPU or CuPy installation.
