def _rocm_preload_torch():
    """Work around a fatal LLVM clash between CuPy and PyTorch on ROCm/HIP.

    On ROCm, CuPy's hipRTC kernel compiler and PyTorch each load AMD's LLVM-based
    code-object manager (``libamd_comgr``). If CuPy is imported before torch, the
    two register the same LLVM command-line options twice and abort the whole
    process with::

        Option 'spirv-expand-step' registered more than once!
        LLVM ERROR: inconsistency in registered CommandLine options

    e.g. when combining classical gpu4pyscf DFT with the Skala ML functional in a
    single process. Importing torch first (when it is installed) makes its comgr
    load first; CuPy then reuses it by soname. No effect on CUDA (CuPy uses NVRTC)
    or when torch is absent. Disable with ``GPU4PYSCF_NO_TORCH_PRELOAD=1``.

    NB: this must not import CuPy -- importing CuPy before torch is itself enough
    to trigger the clash -- so ROCm is detected from the environment instead.
